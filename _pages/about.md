I am a security researcher at Ericsson and PhD candidate at KU Leuven. 


I am interested in memory-safety hardening and improving software resilience. 

Always happy to pitch my ideas for master thesis students and PhD students. Contact me if you need help! 

2025
 * Enjoyed so much at IEEE S&P'25. Discussing all the different security aspects
   made me happy! Impressed me how many people are working on CHERI
   architecture.  So Mon CHERI ❤️ can be found as an [author version of
   paper](../files/author_version/2025_mon_cheri_author_version.pdf),
   [poster](../files/poster/mon_cheri_poster_SP2025.pdf)
  and [presentation](../files/presentation/Gulmez_moncheri_SP.pptx)

 * Good news good news :) Mon CHERI paper got accepted to IEEE S&P. Time for
   travelling to San Francisco! You can read
   the earliest version [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08663). 

 * Happily joined the DSbD event in London with a use case on memory safety for telecommunicatiom  systems. Have a look at [our colorful poster](../files/poster/dsbd.pdf)
 

2024 

  * We have been working on measuring the effectiveness of x86-64 shadow stacks. Our findings indicate that the stack layout can vary across different compilers, and the layout of stack canaries can impact on the effectiveness of the shadow stack. To learn more about our findings, check out our preprint -> [Do we still need canaries in the coal mine? Measuring shadow stack effectiveness in countering stack smashing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16343). 


  * At Ericsson Research, we have assessed the suitability of CHERI for telecommunication systems that require high performance and fault tolerance. To learn more about our findings, check out our [blog post](https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2024/9/memory-safety-in-telecommunications-with-cheri)
  
 
  * I have been working on CHERI for about a year. It has been a long and educational project for me. I worked on extending the qemu simulator, llvm compiler, Flute core, and CheriFreeRTOS. The preprint for "[Mon CHÈRI ♡ Adapting Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC with Conditional Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08663)" is now available here. 

  * I hosted Sacha Ruchlejmer from Phelma University as a master's thesis student. He worked on adapting the secure and rewind discard project to the Arm Morello Board at Ericsson Research. He successfully defended his thesis and graduated from Phelma University; Congrats, Sacha 🎉 You can read his thesis -> [Secure Rewind and Discard on Arm Morello](https://secure-rewind-and-discard.github.io/files/Master_Thesis___Secure_Rewind_on_Discard_on_ARM_Morello.pdf).

  * Our paper, "[System Call Interposition Without Compromise](../files/2024-lazypoline.pdf)" has been accepted at DSN 2024! Here, you can check our library and artifact, [lazypoline](https://github.com/lazypoline).

  * I had the privilege of speaking at FOSDEM 2024. You can find my talk is [here](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2632-friend-or-foe-inside-exploring-in-process-isolation-to-maintain-memory-safety-for-unsafe-rust/)


2023

  * Our research paper, [Friend or Foe Inside? Exploring In-Process Isolation to Maintain Memory Safety for Unsafe Rust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08127.pdf) preprint is available, and it was accepted at [IEEE Sec-Dev-2023 conference](https://secdev.ieee.org/2023/home). 

  * I will be presenting my work "Rewind & Discard: Improving Software Resilience using Isolated Domain" at [IEEE DSN 2023](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/). The technical report is available at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03205.pdf). The source code is available at [here](https://secure-rewind-and-discard.github.io/) *#softwareresillence*

  * I will be presenting my work "[Exploring the Environmental Benefits of In-Process Isolation for Software Resilience](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02131.pdf)", at [IEEE DSN 2023](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/) in June, 2023. The arxiv version is available at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02131.pdf) 

  * [The Climate Crisis is a Digital Rights Crisis: Exploring the Civil-Society Framing of Two Intersecting Disasters](https://limits.pubpub.org/pub/8544yai8/release/1) is out. 

  * I am a publicity chair of [SILM workshop](https://silm-workshop.github.io/). Please check the [call of paper](https://silm-workshop.github.io/cfp/)! 

  * I joined [PrivacyCamp, 2023](https://privacycamp.eu/workshop-the-climate-crisis-is-a-key-digital-rights-issue/). So nice experience!

2022

  * I stayed for one week at Graz University [Summer School: SECURITY, PRIVACY & CORRECTNESS IN THE IOT, 2022, Graz University](https://securityweek.at/2022/). Highly recommended!! 
  
  * I attended the Summer School on Security Testing and Verification at KU Leuven. I did a poster presentation there; please check out [here](../files/SDROB_Poster-E-5CG2171BCR.pdf) 
  * ["Unlimited Lives: Secure In-Process Rollback with Isolated Domains"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03205.pdf) is out! 
  * I got the IEEE Comsoc Turkey Master Thesis Award; you can find my thesis [here](../files/master_thesis)
